      <h4>Design Phase</h4>
      <p>
        In the design phase, ExactFit begins with a wireframe, outlining the main layout and 
        structure of the website. Clients are actively involved, providing input through 
        a moodboard that showcases design styles. The chosen color palette reflects neutrality, 
        sophistication, and modernity with #3c4145 as the primary color, #ff8718 as the accent,
        and #ffffff as the secondary. Fonts, Mulish and Lato, add a minimalist touch, aligning
        with the overall design ethos.

      <h3>Business Overview</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Renuu</strong> is a platform dedicated to sustainability education,
        specifically focusing on sustainability consulting. The company adopts the
        MVP (Minimum Viable Product) methodology for its website, providing a
        foundational slice of the application with plans to incorporate
        more features in the future.

      <h3>Task and Solution</h3>
      <p>
        The primary objective for Renuu was to create a user-friendly, secure, and feature-rich platform that facilitates
        sustainable learning and career transition. The client sought a website with fast loading times, easy navigation,
        and a well-structured design. While the design phase was executed by another designer, my contribution included
        making the website responsive to provide an optimal viewing experience across various devices. The task was to
        provide a secure and efficient learning environment that supports users in their journey towards sustainability.
        </br>
        </br>
        In response to this challenge, a robust solution was crafted, focusing on the implementation of a seamless user
        experience. The website boasts features such as user registration with email confirmation to prevent unauthorized
        access, a dynamic climate quiz powered by AI for engaging content, and an admin dashboard for efficient management
        of activities, courses, and users. Additionally, subscribers benefit from regular newsletters and updates,
        enhancing their overall engagement with the Renuu community.
        </br>
        </br>
        The tech stack chosen for Renuu reflects a commitment to modern development practices, utilizing Next.js for both
        frontend and backend to ensure a responsive and performant application. Tailwind CSS is employed for styling,
        providing a sleek and consistent visual experience. The use of PostgreSQL as the database and Prisma as the ORM
        contributes to the website's stability and data integrity.

    <h2>Web-Scrapper</h2>
    <article>
      <h3>About the Game</h3>
      <p>
        The web scraper operates as the Minesweeper game, where your task involves scraping data from all website cells
        except those belonging to Facebook. Utilize a Left click to perform the scraping action and a Right click to
        bookmark Facebook cells, thereby avoiding interaction with them.
        </br>
        </br>
        The inspiration for this game stems from numerous attempts to extract event data from various websites during my
        graduation project. The project aimed to identify upcoming events in proximity, but encountering strict data
        scraping restrictions from Facebook prompted the creation of this unique game-like solution. Given Facebook's
        legal implications for unauthorized data scraping, the game provides an interactive and educational experience.
      </p>
      <p class='em'>
        <em>
          NOTE: Please be advised that this game is not optimized for mobile devices; therefore, it is recommended to play
          it on a laptop or a desktop computer for the best experience.

      <h3>Tech Stack and Development</h3>
      <p>
        This Single Page Application (SPA) is implemented using vanilla JS, leveraging the History API. The
        http-server-spa npm package is employed to incorporate SPA routing functionality. Unlike the typical http-server,
        this package allows seamless fallback to serving index.html if a route does not match any server resource. This
        behavior aligns with the conventional functioning of a single-page application, preventing the undesired "page not
        found" message when attempting to refresh the page.
